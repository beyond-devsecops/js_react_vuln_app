# **Vulnerable Application Findings**

To include both frontend and backend findings, a total of 12–15 findings would provide a comprehensive analysis of the application’s vulnerabilities. Here’s a breakdown:

## **Findings: Frontend Vulnerabilities**

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    - **Issue:** Unsanitized user input is reflected in the DOM, allowing script execution.
    - **Example Exploit:** Inject \\\`<script>alert('XSS Exploited!');</script>\\\` in the comment field.

2. **Insecure Local Storage**
    - **Issue:** Sensitive data (e.g., passwords) are stored in \\\`localStorage\\\`, exposing them to browser-based attacks.
    - **Example Exploit:** Use browser developer tools to extract stored credentials.

3. **Sensitive Information in the DOM**
    - **Issue:** API keys or sensitive tokens are exposed in HTML or JavaScript files.
    - **Example Exploit:** Inspect the DOM for the API key (\\\`123456-SECRET-API-KEY\\\`).

4. **Improper Error Handling**
    - **Issue:** Detailed backend error messages are displayed to users.
    - **Example Exploit:** Trigger a malformed request to see raw backend errors.

5. **Clickjacking**
    - **Issue:** The application lacks \\\`X-Frame-Options\\\` or CSP headers, allowing embedding in iframes.
    - **Example Exploit:** Create a malicious iframe embedding the app to steal user input.

6. **Excessive Client-Side Trust**
    - **Issue:** Critical validation is performed only on the frontend, making it easy to bypass using developer tools.
    - **Example Exploit:** Remove \\\`required\\\` attributes from form fields and submit empty data.

7. **Weak Content Security Policy (CSP) (Optional)**
    - **Issue:** CSP headers are missing, enabling injection of malicious scripts or resources.
    - **Example Exploit:** Host a malicious script and reference it in the app via injected \\\`<script>\\\` tags.

## **Findings: Backend Vulnerabilities**

8. **SQL Injection**
    - **Issue:** User input is directly concatenated into SQL queries without sanitization.
    - **Example Exploit:** Log in by injecting \\\`' OR 1=1 --\\\` into the username field.

9. **Hardcoded Credentials**
    - **Issue:** Database credentials are hardcoded in the backend code, exposing them to source code leaks or malicious insiders.
    - **Example Exploit:** Extract the credentials from \\\`index.js\\\` to connect directly to the database.

10. **Weak Password Hashing**
    - **Issue:** MD5 is used for hashing passwords, which is considered insecure due to precomputed hash attacks (e.g., rainbow tables).
    - **Example Exploit:** Crack the hashed password (\\\`MD5('password')\\\`) using publicly available tools.

11. **Command Injection**
    - **Issue:** User input is passed directly to shell commands, enabling arbitrary code execution.
    - **Example Exploit:** Use the \\\`/exec\\\` endpoint with \\\`cmd=ls\\\` or \\\`cmd=cat /etc/passwd\\\` to retrieve sensitive data.

12. **File Upload Without Validation**
    - **Issue:** Files are uploaded to the server without any validation, allowing malicious files to be saved.
    - **Example Exploit:** Upload a PHP web shell or executable script to gain remote access.

13. **Sensitive Information Exposure**
    - **Issue:** The \\\`/debug\\\` endpoint exposes environment variables, including sensitive configuration details.
    - **Example Exploit:** Access \\\`/debug\\\` to retrieve database credentials and API keys.

14. **Insecure API Endpoints**
    - **Issue:** The backend does not validate user authorization, allowing unauthorized API access.
    - **Example Exploit:** Access \\\`/admin\\\` or \\\`/users\\\` endpoints without proper authentication.

15. **Race Condition**
    - **Issue:** The \\\`/increment\\\` endpoint uses a shared variable without proper synchronization, leading to inconsistent states.
    - **Example Exploit:** Trigger multiple requests simultaneously to manipulate the counter.
